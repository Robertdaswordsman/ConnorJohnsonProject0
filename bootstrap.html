        <h1>D&D 5th edition rule help page</h1>
        <p>This page is a designed to be a help page for new players to 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons</p>
        <P>D&D is widely known as a tabletop 'roleplay' game, and has been steeped in superstition for many years as a shady game. This couldn't be further from the truth, and thanks to more favourable portrayal in media (You may have seen it showcased in Netflix original Stranger Things), coupled with it's now revolutionary rules system, 5th edition (5e), D&D has recently surged in popularity.</P>

            <h3>How does this game work?</h3>
            <P>Dungeons and Dragons (commonly referred to as D&D) at its core boils down to the following setup: first a group of 3 to 6 players create characters using 5th edition’s ruling system. This process is similar to writing a character for a novel in a particular themed setting (usually high fantasy, Lord of the Rings style), except the strengths and weaknesses of the character are tracked with numbers and percentile modifiers that increase or decrease your odds of success in certain situations. The intricacies and nuances of constructing a character sheet are outside the scope of this help sheet, though the following video provides a brief explanation on making and using a 5th edition character sheet: </P>
            <a></a>
            <P>Once the character sheet is created, the players are narrated through a set story managed by another individual who, instead of having a character to play as, is in charge of narrating the story in which the player’s characters experience the game. This individual is known as the Game Master, and is responsible for narrating the story, controlling monsters that the players fight, and assigning rewards to the risks that the party faces on their daring adventure. A Game Master (GM) is usually a role assigned to an experienced player who already knows most of the rules, though knowing ALL the rules in 5th edition D&D is absolutely not a requirement. Regardless of what kind of story the GM is telling for a game (intrigue, survival, horror, and open world exploration are popular ones) most games require the player’s characters to be able to fight, and a solid number of the rules that apply to player characters are solely dedicated to combat. </P>

            <h3>What is this webpage?</h3>
            <p>This help page assumes you have constructed a character sheet already, or at least have one made for you upon playing the game. This web page is meant to refresh your knowledge of your characters capabilities, and the rules of the game that actually matter to you. Not even the GM knows all the rules of the game, and frequently has to look up rules on the fly that actually mater to the game that is currently being played. Technology has made this much easier than it was in the past. Due to the COVID 19 pandemic in 2020, Wizards of the Coast, the brand owner of Dungeons and Dragons, decided to allow the release of essentially all its source material in order to promote online play of D&D. For both GMs and players, this means that information that would previously have to be looked up in a physical, hard copy book can now be very easily accessed via the power of the internet. Therefore, in addition to reminding players of their characters capabilities in the game, this page also provides links to web pages to help provide easy access to resources and rules that apply to your character.  
                To use this webpage, return to the main page using the following link and follow the checklist of yes or no questions. Those pages will contain

            <h3>Can’t the GM tell me this?</h3>
            <p>All the rules that are covered in this page and the links therein are ones that the GM do use themselves to run monsters. Therefore they most certainly capable of explaining these rules to you, possibly in greater detail. 
                However, when these rules matter most, the GM is most likely in the middle of running the game, whether this is managing the flow of a combat, or narrating and describing the setting. This page provides a means of refreshing yourself on those key rules that matter to you without disturbing the flow of the game. Especially in a fight, having to stop the game in order to remind you of a rule can break the flow of the game, especially if it has to be done more than thrice in succession. The GM is a player in this game as well, so doing your part to not hamper them shows you both respect the GM and your fellow players.
