        <P>First, determine if you are a martial or spellcaster class using the table bellow. Some classes are both (though they are usually half as effective as ones that are one or the other)</P>

          <p>Martial Classes usually take an attack action while casters usually use spells</p>
          <h1>Use a weapon to attack</h1>
          <p>An attack in d&d consists of two rolls: An attack roll and a damage roll. An attack roll determines if you hit, and a damage roll determines how much damage you deal.</p>
          <p>Determine if your weapon uses strength or dexterity to attack. If the weapon says it is ranged, or it has the 'finesse' property, it uses dexterity. Otherwise it uses strength (most melee weapons)</p> 
          <p>Roll a d20 for each attack you make this turn. Add your appropriate modifier (dexterity or strength) and your proficiency bonus. If you are a martial class above 5th level, you make two rolls instead of 1. </p>
          <p>If you match your target's armor class (AC) then the attack hits! Now roll damage. The die you use to determine damage is determined by the weapon you used, and then add your appropriate modifier (dexterity or strength). Do NOT add your proficiency bonus to your damage roll, that's just for attacks </p>
          <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Weapons#content">This sheet contains properties of the weapon you use, as well as their damage dice.</a>
          <h1>Cast a spell</h1>
          <p>Consult your classes spell list to determine what spells you can cast. Some spells are similar to weapon attacks, and may require an attack roll and a damage roll as well. Others will require a creature to roll against your spell save DC (a number which is 8 + the modifier of the ability you use to cast spells + your proficiency bonus) to avoid it. If they roll bellow that DC, they fail, and the spell takes full effect.</p>
