        <h1>Bonus Actions</h1>
        <p>Bonus actions are special in 5th edition, and are treated as actions so quick, they take only half a second to trigger. There are no common bonus actions for you to use, but there are many associated with your class. Take note, many of them have a specific number of uses. Most commonly, you will be faced with the following scenarios:</p>
        <div class="success">Your Class gives you a special bonus action that you can use here!</div>
        <div class="warning">Your Class has access to a spell that can be cast as a bonus action. Decide if it's worth it to use it now</div>
        <div class="error">You don't have any bonus action you can use. Oh well</div>
    </body>
